# Hey there, welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

## About Me
Hey! I'm a full-stack developer in the making, currently learning at 4Geeks Academy. I'm passionate about building cool projects 🚀, learning new stuff, and tackling challenges (with an energy drink in hand ☕, obviously).

## What I Love
- **Learning**: I'm always up for trying out new things and tools (even if I have to look up 90% of it). 🤓📚
- **Collaboration**: I enjoy working in teams, pairing programming, and sharing knowledge with people. 🤝👨‍💻👩‍💻


## Projects & Contributions
I'm still working on the bootcamp's projects and I’m always up for feedback, so feel free to reach out or open an issue on any of my projects! 🛠️💬

## Let’s Connect!
