## Projects & Contributions

🏆 The project I'm most proud of is Zuply, a full-featured application I initially created as the final project for my first coding bootcamp.
It’s a restaurant management system designed to streamline orders, products, and supplier coordination.
The project is still evolving, and we continue to improve its functionality, scalability, and user experience as part of an ongoing team effort.
